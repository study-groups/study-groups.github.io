<h1 class="main-header" >Knowing Gaia</h1>
<h2 id='c1'>Ch 1. ~  Introduction</h2>

<p id='c1-par1'>
<span class='sentence'>
After many years of Buddhist study and practice, and being influenced by less traditional non-duality speakers, I was inspired to develop a contemplation practice called "Knowing Gaia".

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I've combined my experience of meditation and a Buddhist world view with a more contemporary approach which is not based on any spiritual authority.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In "Knowing Gaia" a scientific world view is bent a little bit in the direction of intuition, poetry and mysticism without making up any stories which contradict our modern common sense.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The text is more of an invitation than a guide, and readers are expected to make their own discoveries which may well be radically different from my own.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c1-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia, from Greek mythology, can be thought of as 'Mother Earth'.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The mythology includes stories of creation, primordial conflict and shifting rulers.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Here, I'm using a contemporary concept of Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
James Lovelock, an English scientist and inventor, started it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
He was working for NASA investigating planetary atmospheres when he started thinking about how very odd Earth's atmosphere is, how unstable and unlikely.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Of course this is a result of life processes exchanging gases, impossible for a non-living planet.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
He realized that not only does life adapt to changing conditions, but also changes conditions itself in a dynamic, self-regulating system.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c1-par3'>
<span class='sentence'>
There was nothing anthropomorphic in his idea, but his friend, novelist William Golding, found it poetic and suggested calling it 'Gaia' rather than a more prosaic 'Earth systems science'.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c1-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
Some people have been enchanted by the poetry into thinking that our Earth will take care of us.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Unfortunately, we don't know that.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Evidence so far suggests that Gaia is heartless.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We are only as special as we make ourselves to be.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia is mother to all her children - frog and fly, Neanderthal and Homo Sapiens.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Life forms thrive, or not, in an ever-changing web.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Everyone needs something to eat.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Animals eat plants which were thriving on the carbon dioxide exhaled by those very animals.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The animals are thriving on the oxygen produced by the plants they are killing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Yet the whole complex system not only continues, but continues to develop more complexity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It almost seems alive, and so, following Lovelock, I'm calling it Gaia.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c1-par5'>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm setting aside the fact that traditional ideas of 'mother' imply the existence of 'father'.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Let's just say the Sun is our father, and go ahead with Gaia as our subject.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Think of the earth and everything on it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The oceans are home to phytoplankton cells in the billions, each separately working away at photosynthesis, releasing trace amounts of oxygen.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Diatoms not only give us oxygen, but lock carbon in their miniscule shells.The shells drop down through the water when the diatom dies, taking that bit of carbon with them, cooling the planet, to the benefit of the living diatoms and everyone else who likes the temperature the way it is.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Having discovered the amazing convenience of fossil fuels, we humans are about to defeat their efforts.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Certain species of jellyfish think that's a great idea! They are already showing up in unprecedented numbers.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So, who is choosing the future?

</span>
</p>

<p id='c1-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
At the time of the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs, small mammals were living in burrows, out of danger from the huge beasts who had ruled the planet for 175 million years.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
These small rat-like mammals would not be our first choice of an ancestor, but hiding in their burrows they survived the fires and extreme conditions following the impact, and became our ancestors.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
From a combination of chance, time and natural selection in a complex, self-regulating system, we emerged.

</span>
</p><h2 id='c2'>Ch 2. ~  Taking a leap into the deeply personal</h2>

<p id='c2-par1'>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation is a way of investigating experiences which are particularly difficult to capture in symbols.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
"The name you can say isn't the real name" is how Ursula LeGuin expresses it in the beginning of her version of the Tao Te Ching.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But there's no point in trying to stop thinking.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Any attempt we make to stop thinking only fuels conflict resulting in either more frantic thinking, or a frozen silence, neither of which is productive of insight.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
And it is insight that I'm after, that's the goal - to bring awareness into what I've been ignoring.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c2-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
How do I do that? First, it's important to state that how I do it is probably different from how you do it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Let's not get religious or ideological about a process which is so essentially personal.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The question is simple and pragmatic - what works? And how do we know it is working? Let's say you're on a boat touring Antarctica and you suddenly feel a vastness which doesn't make you feel small, but includes you with a sudden loss of boundary.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
You look around at your fellow passengers and feel a surge of warmth, an appreciation for how unique and precious every single one of them is.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Or let's say I'm in the garden picking strawberries and I ease into a vivid perception of red and green which makes me feel so much more alive than usual.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The tangle of leaf, flower and fruit suddenly seems miraculous, a gift.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I have an urge to share this gift with everyone I know.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
In both cases we have unexpectedly discovered something about ourselves, and about Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Something we were not noticing before.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
In both cases words like vastness, precious, vivid, gift, contain only the slightest hint of the experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What caused that shift in perception? Was it something we did sometime in the past? Was it brain chemistry? Was it a stage in a quest? Was it because we listened to one of the many people giving advice or teachings? Who knows.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We can only make a guess and judge for ourselves how to proceed.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c2-par3'>
<span class='sentence'>
Developing an appetite for a state of unabsorbed flow has been very helpful for me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Usually we experience something like 'flow' when absorbed in some activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Any activity which absorbs our attention, while encouraging a flow state, is what I'm calling 'absorbed flow'.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We lose track of time, and effort becomes a simple flow of energy.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What I mean by 'unabsorbed flow' is something quite different.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
You don't lose yourself in an activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Also, you don't enter into any non-ordinary mind state as with a drug or other extreme or unusual experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It feels completely like 'plain old me', but with a crucial difference.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The 'me' in the unabsorbed flow state is light, often to the point of dissolution, but not because it's been absorbed into an activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Rather, there has been a thinning of a sense of separation.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We become more available to what is actually here.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c2-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation comes naturally when we relax with uncertainty.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We don't need to manufacture any special mind states.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Our conditioning, however, is well established.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We think we like it because it is so familiar.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm suggesting there is something more natural, more nourishing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Doing something unnatural might help us get back in touch with the basics.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Using the principles of Gaia, I have some questions and statements which help me understand myself and the world better by serving as prompts for contemplation.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c2-par5'>
<span class='sentence'>
Here are the ten prompts I'm using.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
You could try making up your own.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Just think of some questions or statements which will challenge your own deeply held assumptions.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c2-p0'>
P1: Since living systems do not exist independently in nature, what am I? What does that feel like?

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p1'>
P2: Integrity is a function of how well a system is integrated. Are any conflicting emotions currently creating instability in me? 

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p2'>
P3: The problem with living in a dream is that real people get hurt. What's my most recent example of that?

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p3'>
P4: If I'm not feeling my inner body right now, I'm not feeling anything. Take a moment to check in. 

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p4'>
P5: Since Gaia is what's real, any gap in honesty separates us. I can only be honest with myself if I listen to my whole self. How can I do that?

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p5'>
P6: How much power do you think you have? How much do you want? How much does the other person have? How much do you think they want?

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p6'>
P7: What am I being touched by right now, physically, emotionally, intellectually?

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p7'>
P8: How does ideology creep into your thinking? What does it offer you? What does it take away from knowing Gaia?

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p8'>
P9: We're breathing, we're feeling the force of gravity. Paying attention to both at once places us squarely in the presence of Gaia. Try it. 

</h3>
<h3 id='c2-p9'>
P10: Does Gaia have a self? What would that mean? 

</h3>

<p id='c2-par16'>
<span class='sentence'>
Now I'm going to circle through the prompts a number of times using a different lens each time.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Feel free to skip around throughout the text.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This is not a narrative.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Rather, it's a series of reflections.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
You may find some provocative, some obvious, others irrelevant.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It doesn't matter.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Go with what helps you expand your own direct perception, and call it what you will.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c2-par17'>
<span class='sentence'>
Touching Gaia can be a bit of a shock, causing a reflexive withdrawal.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That's why I think it's helpful to keep coming back, from different angles, with different points of contemplation, none more important than any other.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm hoping that what I've written will invite you into your own language and natural pathways.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Keep in mind that we are doing an investigation together.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
No one is telling us how it should be done, or what we will find.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c2-par18'>
<span class='sentence'>
For a bit of refreshment, I've included some youtube clips.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Take a look...

</p><h2 id='c3'>Ch 3. ~  First Impressions</h2>
<h3 id='c3-p0'>
P1: Since living systems do not exist independently in nature, what am I? What does that feel like?

</h3>

<p id='c3-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation begins with our ability to talk to ourselves.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This ability can sometimes seem like it's out of control, turned into an exhausting, meaningless stream of chatter.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
However, like Gaia, the brain is a self-regulating system.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The stream of chatter is not coming from a dumb machine.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It is running alongside intelligent awareness.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
An impulse to slow down and find meaning can arise, fed by our curiosity about ourselves.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Probing questions can redirect our attention away from problems we can't solve, to our most basic problem which is our misunderstanding about who and what we are.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
These days we have ample information from outside to support us in this inner work.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But I have to do the work for myself, no one can do it for me.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c3-p1'>
P2: Integrity is a function of how well a system is integrated. Are any conflicting emotions currently creating instability in me? 

</h3>

<p id='c3-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia creates by chance, not by design, and then gives beings free rein to design themselves.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We admire flowers without seeing the lines insects can perceive on some petals, leading the way to nectar, pollen and stigma.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's hard for us to believe that small, random shifts in genetics favoring specific behavior has produced this intricate and highly balanced partnership between bugs and plants with no access to planning ahead.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
In the past, people made up fantastic stories about invisible sources of intelligence, but our human intelligence gradually asserted its integrity and demanded that explanations be based on observation rather than conjecture.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Emotions run between mind and body.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Observing my emotions can direct me toward what needs to be integrated.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c3-p2'>
P3: The problem with living in a dream is that real people get hurt. What's my most recent example of that?

</h3>

<p id='c3-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
Accurate predictions transcend our personal hopes and fears.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Caught in a dream state, we are trapped in the personal.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Stepping outside the dream state, we can perceive our surroundings clearly.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We can see how, even with the best intentions, we hurt other people.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We can see how they hurt us, in spite of their best intentions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Attempting to choose what I think are the best bits for me, I make bad predictions about the future.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Our decisions affect the environment, economy, international politics, all aspects of our world.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's bewildering.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Turning to religion or political ideology for guidance, I miss the complexity of present conditions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So I have to rely on my own intuition, even as I work on refining it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams can help! But only if I'm able to identify a dream as a dream, and make predictions based on what's possible.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c3-p3'>
P4: If I'm not feeling my inner body right now, I'm not feeling anything. Take a moment to check in. 

</h3>

<p id='c3-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
We all know the body is a dynamic system of interacting organs, cells, chemical reactions, messages, fluid transport, exchange of gases and home to colonies of microbes.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We take all that for granted.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When something hurts, we pay attention.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
What happens if I pay attention to the inner workings when there is no problem? It's like entering a forest with unexpected small creeks or sudden bursts of sunlight.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's like noticing the sound of a breeze, call of a bird, odor of damp rotting leaves, an endless feast of sensations, direct perception of Gaia in action.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The body wants to listen to itself, the subtle messages which usually go unheard as we are preoccupied with the constant narrative of the mind.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
A state of unabsorbed flow radiates outward from the inner body, and we can tune in to that any time.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c3-p4'>
P5: Since Gaia is what's real, any gap in honesty separates us. I can only be honest with myself if I listen to my whole self. How can I do that?

</h3>

<p id='c3-par10'>
<span class='sentence'>
Or maybe I don't even want to because I think it's already automatically happening, or maybe I'm afraid of getting some bad news about myself.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can start with whatever is blocking the process, knowing what I have to work with.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I don't know where the drive toward wholeness is coming from, but it's undeniable.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's also intuitively obvious that separation is fed by self-deception.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This is a tough one.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That's why it's so important to have a broad focus, contemplating a few different areas which invite me to go further.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation can produce unusual mind states which tempt us to make up interesting stories which are not anchored in actual experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
An unabsorbed flow state is full of gaps, open to unexpected new information.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c3-p5'>
P6: How much power do you think you have? How much do you want? How much does the other person have? How much do you think they want?

</h3>

<p id='c3-par12'>
<span class='sentence'>
Power to do what? Maybe all we want is the power to make the other person think we have more power than they do.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Having the means to push other people around isn't power, it's force.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Having enough nuclear weapons to obliterate another country in a first strike isn't power, it's force.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We want the power to create, but that power belongs to Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Our predictions tend to be faulty, so our attempts to create a better world are rife with unintended consequences.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia operates through probabilities rather than preconceptions, and the only real power is in what's possible.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c3-p6'>
P7: What am I being touched by right now, physically, emotionally, intellectually? 

</h3>

<p id='c3-par14'>
<span class='sentence'>
I know I'm out of touch with Gaia, that's why I'm doing this practice.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I know intellectually that I exist as a collection of processes, but I'm out of touch with those processes.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That leaves me subject to misconceptions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So I need to take a backward step, out of thinking, out of doing, into more basic experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When I simply rest with awareness of the chair touching me, the sunlight coming through the window, the sound of the refrigerator, the smell of mint tea, everything comes alive.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Then I can even feel touched by the idea 'everything comes alive'.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Touched also by my hesitation to say something which might sound silly.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
No need to correct anything, because I'm simply being touched by all these things, not trapped by them.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c3-p7'>
P8: How does ideology creep into your thinking? What does it offer you? What does it take away from knowing Gaia?

</h3>

<p id='c3-par16'>
<span class='sentence'>
An ideology is simply a system of ideas.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our problem is that the mind grasps onto concepts, narrative, names, labels, symbols, and uses those unreliable mental constructs as the basis for an equally unreliable self-image.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
At that point ideology becomes a filter.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Not only is perception reduced but the filter becomes predominantly what we experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Ideology makes me part of a system of ideas, with a nice feeling of being right.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Some other people agree with me, reenforcing my confidence.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Some other people disagree with us, reenforcing our sense of solidarity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Holding on to this security makes us afraid to open up perception to the complexity all around us because it can be so confusing.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c3-p8'>
P9: We're breathing, we're feeling the force of gravity. Paying attention to both at once places us squarely in the presence of Gaia. Try it. 

</h3>

<p id='c3-par18'>
<span class='sentence'>
We depend on oxygen.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We can't taste, touch or see it, but we have evolved to continually breathe, trusting the air.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It feels very good to notice the process more consciously.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gravity is also a constant source of experience which we tend to neglect.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We are surrounded by life forms with individual methods of respiration and some means of working with gravity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Tiny life forms in the ocean must adapt to the tendency of cold water to sink and warm water to rise.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Huge trees must balance the weight of their limbs so they don't pull the trunk down.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We do well to take a little time to give our usual concerns a rest, and focus on what is most near and most essential to life in each moment.

P10: Does Gaia have a self? What would that mean?

</h3>

<p id='c3-par20'>
<span class='sentence'>
Self exists only in relationship with other.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
By naming Gaia we are giving an impersonal system an identity related to a human self.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia has no way to know we're doing this, while we have a system of mental activity which is able to know what it is doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We also have the ability to study systems outside ourselves, find boundaries, give names.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If our minds became fully integrated with Gaia, as our bodies already are, perhaps we would be Gaia's self.

<h3 id='c4-p0'>
P1: independently

</h3>

<p id='c4-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia is a self-regulating system in which no part exists independently.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia is dependent on the sun, rocks, water, air.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Every part of Gaia is dependent on the whole.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
One part, let's say Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, could die off and the whole would continue, although certain other parts would be affected.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Some local willows might flourish.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If the whole system crashed could any bighorn sheep remain? Obviously not.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We humans, however, have been led to believe that somewhere at the center of our being is a 'me' which stands alone.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This independently existing static entity is supposed to be free and responsible, subject to reward and punishment, praise and blame, inclusion and banishment.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
How do you think that idea took hold? Because it is a very convenient form of social control.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p1'>
P2: integrated

</h3>

<p id='c4-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia is strong because all parts must adapt to the whole.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Each individual organism contains systems which support that organism's ability to adapt.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Sometimes the internal systems aren't even related to that individual.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Cows can eat grass because they have a special stomach where they host microbes which produce enzymes able to digest cellulose.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Humans have developed language, a system available to each individual but able to survive that individual's death.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If an isolated language dies, the concept of 'language' lives on, and people can learn another language, making human culture an increasingly robust system.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p2'>
P3: dream

</h3>

<p id='c4-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams add to the diversity of experience, enriching Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But dreams don't make the rules which we must follow if we are to flourish.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia doesn't make the rules, either.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia is the action of the rules.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's why it's so important that we work on knowing Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We can follow our dreams as much as we want, we have the freedom to do that, but we don't have the freedom to determine the consequences.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Knowing Gaia is a process of awakening, and dreams are much more useful when we're awake.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p3'>
P4: body

</h3>

<p id='c4-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
Knowing Gaia doesn't happen through words, although words can play a part.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The body's way of knowing is feeling.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's too bad we usually ignore those subtle feelings coming from deep inside until pain demands our attention.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Experiencing our own physical well being is a direct experience of Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The body is a complex self-regulating ecosystem just like Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
And just like Gaia we do not consciously experience the myriad interactions.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If I let my attention wander around to different areas I may notice a tight muscle, or that my feet are tired, but I won't be able to detect what my kidneys are doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The dominant sensation is unitary.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I think of it as 'aliveness'.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The same is true of sensing what Gaia is doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
As I become less focused on separation, I can feel that I am part of something much bigger than I am.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
As I become more curious about what that is, I can consciously study what other people have investigated.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That conscious study can then include the details of what the body is doing.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p4'>
P5: honesty

</h3>

<p id='c4-par10'>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia has allowed some devious creatures to come forth.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A type of hawk moth caterpillar has markings which mimic a pit viper to scare off predators.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
People can tell each other fantastic stories to encourage cooperation, stories of punishment we experience while dead, or rewards in a next life.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia doesn't listen to stories, Gaia sees behavior.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If the caterpillar fools a bird, good for the caterpillar! If people fool themselves and each other, the resulting behavior might be adaptive, or it might not be.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Humans are such habitual liars that we need the concept of 'honesty'.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia doesn't care about that, but we can't know Gaia without the simplicity and directness of honesty.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p5'>
P6: power

</h3>

<p id='c4-par12'>
<span class='sentence'>
You know that Gaia owns the power because you know that ugly surprises await all of us, even the most supposedly powerful individuals.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Beautiful surprises are also just around the corner, and, we suspect, beyond our control.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We are driven by a strong desire for dominance.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The mystique of power gets folded into the near constant struggle for dominance and status.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We are complicated organisms who can make strategic decisions to play along to get along.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We also invent things which carry benefits or dangers, and we have a certain amount of control over those things.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We are also subject to unintended consequences.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When we make accurate predictions, Gaia rewards us handsomely.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Inaccurate predictions sometimes work out just fine, and sometimes not.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Then we pay the price.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p6'>
P7: touched

</h3>

<p id='c4-par14'>
<span class='sentence'>
Touching is personal.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If Gaia isn't something which touches me, there's no point in knowing about Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can know all sorts of things which are impersonal, like how to make polenta.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But if no one tastes the polenta, if the knowledge remains impersonal, then it's of no use.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
A theory of Gaia which describes earth systems science, however accurately, doesn't become truly useful until it touches us personally.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Human experience has expanded into mental realms so compelling that I am overwhelmed and out of touch.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Paying more attention to how one particular form is touching me relaxes distortions and clears my senses, offering a window to the activity of Gaia.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p7'>
P8: ideology

</h3>

<p id='c4-par16'>
<span class='sentence'>
Ideology creates tunnel vision.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Knowing Gaia requires openness.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia can be used as an ideology just as easily as any other set of concepts.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It happens when we forget that a concept is a tool to be used.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Concepts are not a direct reflection of reality, but constructed through our own mental processes.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Even if we understand that a concept is just a tool, we can misuse that tool to support useless activity like wanting to feel like I know something special, therefore I must be special.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When that happens I develop a need to defend my concepts instead of continuing to explore how useful they are and for what job.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p8'>
P9: presence

</h3>

<p id='c4-par18'>
<span class='sentence'>
It takes a lot of work to sit and breathe.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The blood in my feet must somehow make it to my kidneys.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's literally a matter of life and death.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The cells in my lungs must accurately select some elements of the air and reject others.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There's nothing in my experience which informs me of how to consciously do that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Yet I can sense that beneath my gross perceptions of light, sound, temperature, tension and so on, is a field of existence.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There is an undifferentiated experience of aliveness which reveals itself in silence.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c4-p9'>
P10: self

</h3>

<p id='c4-par20'>
<span class='sentence'>
There is a strange and wild beauty in a system which is unintentionally self-regulating.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There is no need to anthropomorphize if what we are talking about includes humans.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia is not a person, but I am, and totally dependent upon Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Other life systems are increasingly dependent upon human activity, and our ability to limit our own destructiveness.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If we want Gaia to continue to favor us, we might need to offer ourselves as Gaia's brain.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
From that, we will see what kind of self naturally emerges.

<h3 id='c5-p0'>
P1: Since living systems do not exist independently in nature, what am I? What does that feel like?

</h3>

<p id='c5-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
What a relief it is to stop trying to do the impossible, even for a moment, to step back from trying to be a person made of words.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I already know that the words in my head are not the things they represent, so how about not listening for a little while.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can take a break, turn my attention to unity rather than further division.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can allow Gaia to do the work.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Just as I trust that the work of keeping me alive will continue when I fall asleep, I can turn my awake attention toward stillness and the ground of being.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c5-p1'>
P2: Integrity is a function of how well a system is integrated. Are any conflicting emotions currently creating instability in me? 

</h3>

<p id='c5-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
Emotions generate stories, and it's easier to listen to the stories than to feel the emotions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We can approach emotions as music within the body, listen carefully to how different tensions create a range of feelings.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The narrative can then start to fade into the background while the physical sensations bring us closer to the underlying motivations.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Harmony brings stability and clarity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Our whole system, mind and body, seeks balance.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If we dive beneath the surface waves of confusion, into the quiet depths, balance and buoyancy are simply there.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c5-p2'>
P3: The problem with living in a dream is that real people get hurt. What's my most recent example of that? 

</h3>

<p id='c5-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams enrich our lives.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I don't want to live without dreams.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Neither do I want to live in a dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The first person to be hurt when I live in a dream is myself.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams are intensely personal, and make it impossible to love another person who is living in their own dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I used to dream that I would find another person who lived in my dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Didn't happen.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
What happened instead is that I discovered, through a window of silence, how to open to what is actually here.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There's nothing better in the gap between past and future.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c5-p3'>
P4: If I'm not feeling my inner body right now, I'm not feeling anything. Take a moment to check in.

</h3>

<p id='c5-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
The mind will continue to generate words because there is a part of me which believes it's necessary.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There's another part of me which is able to perceive the unity underneath the division.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c5-par9'>
<span class='sentence'>
Habitually, we pay more attention to words.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our environment has become choked with words, because, yes, the ability to use words is absolutely crucial for humans.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We hope we can find unity through words and symbols, or maybe through a prescribed set of activities such as 'pay more attention to the inner body'.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I'm only suggesting you do that because I find it relatively easy and effective.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Words are objects we can grasp, and so are the sensations of the body.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Yet, somehow, feeling the sensations without making up a story about them can soften and open the mind.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It does take practice to not make up yet another story about the body.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c5-p4'>
P5: Since Gaia is what's real, any gap in honesty separates us. I can only be honest with myself if I listen to my whole self. How can I do that? 

</h3>

<p id='c5-par11'>
<span class='sentence'>
Recognizing my filter of hopes and fears, I have to loosen up in order to allow more information to come in.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If my motivation for allowing more information in is to protect me from my fears and advance the agendas of my hopes, o.k.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's what is happening.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But we humans are smart.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's why Gaia should be afraid of us! We have the capability to crash the system.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So let's be honest about that.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We can sit around talking about 'knowing Gaia' while our carbon emissions are accumulating in tons.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We can sit in silence while other people are fighting mega-fires in Australia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We can practice being honest with ourselves for no other reason than it's what we feel is right, then see what happens.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c5-p5'>
P6: How much power do you think you have? How much do you want? How much does the other person have? How much do you think they want?

</h3>

<p id='c5-par13'>
<span class='sentence'>
Thinking we need power keeps us running in circles, generating a torrent of words.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We may be free from attachment to the usual status symbols, but still thinking 'knowledge is power'.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But then how much knowledge do I need? Is it possible to just pause for a bit? When I pause with no loss of alertness, I can sense my own energy.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I'm using the word 'energy' in the basic sense of 'ability to do work', not as some quality which is mysterious and unique to me, not as some 'power'.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Energy, unlike power, is not guaranteed to get me what I want.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Ability to do work may advance my personal agenda, or may not, depending on the situation.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In quietness I've discovered something more reliable than the ability to do work.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
My conscious connection to Gaia allows me to rest.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In deep rest I get a glimmer of basic being, in which there is no need to do anything.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c5-p6'>
P7: What am I being touched by right now, physically, emotionally, intellectually? 

</h3>

<p id='c5-par15'>
<span class='sentence'>
I am being touched by other people's words all the time.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Words spoken to me in the past, all the way back to my most vulnerable childhood years, reverberate in memory.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Words hurled at me when I was a confused adolescent are still shaping me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There are more gentle, nurturing messages from the forces keeping me alive now which I could give some attention.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The electric light I switch on at night carries a message I might focus on for a moment.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It is a message of caring combined with human ingenuity, touching me directly, now.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can shift my attention to sounds, especially in a quiet place away from the roar of traffic.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia is active everywhere, and our physical senses evolved in harmony with our source - sun, rocks, water, air.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There's nothing supernatural about that, and it's easy to notice.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I hold a rock in my hand and allow it to touch me, it can be seen as a tool, a weapon, a garden ornament or simply a rock.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When I dig in the garden and notice what happens to rocks when acted upon by countless generations of microbes allied with plants, I realize that I am eating rocks every day.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
An idea like that also touches me emotionally, beyond the words, sinks into my body, reassuring my gut that life goes on.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c5-p7'>
P8: How does ideology creep into your thinking? What does it offer you? What does it take away from knowling Gaia? 

</h3>

<p id='c5-par17'>
<span class='sentence'>
It takes a lot of words to construct and maintain an ideology.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The word 'Gaia' does not convey an ideology.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The narrative I've been developing here could easily become an ideology.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That's why it's so important to practice shifting attention away from words.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There is no method for doing that, but if for some unknown reason your motivation is strong, you will find a way.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If my motivation is to advance myself through an ideology, I will never know Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Knowing Gaia demands surrender.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It might not make me happy.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There's a good chance it will scare me, and I have to take that chance.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
What I've seen of Gaia so far tells me that I am unique, but nothing out of the ordinary.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Ideologies of all kinds, religious, political, pseudo-scientific promise an unassailable identity, an individual merger with what appears more powerful than myself as an individual.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
My experience has been that the sooner you unmask the desire for power, the sooner you will start noticing the incredible beauty of things as they are.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c5-p8'>
P9: We're breathing, we're feeling the force of gravity. Paying attention to both at once places us squarely in the presence of Gaia. Try it. 

</h3>

<p id='c5-par19'>
<span class='sentence'>
Shifting attention away from our habitual pursuits takes faith.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I'd like to distinguish faith from belief.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Belief depends on concepts; faith comes from direct experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Faith guides us forward into that which is beyond the small, individual self activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm calling that larger activity Gaia, but that's just a name.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
You might have a name for it which is more meaningful to you.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I just want to encourage you to get into it to the point where it's not threatened by silence.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That takes work because faith can be blocked by boredom.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Part of our mind is so addicted to mental junk food that it keeps reaching for the next symbolic chip and the next and the next.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It takes work to redirect attention away from words.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If the motivation isn't strong we're going to quickly find a reason to quit.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When the motivation is limited to a desire to feel good, feel secure, feel powerful, feel confident, feel loving or any other state which is temporary by nature, we will not practice knowing Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Only faith in the entire range of activity which can occur will give us the energy to do this work.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This faith is ungraspable, yet so simple.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm suggesting a technique: shift attention to breathing and gravity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If you have a better technique, of course you will do that one.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If you can open to what is here now using no technique, no concepts, no practice, no help from

</span>

P10: Does Gaia have a self? What would that mean?

</h3>

<p id='c5-par22'>
<span class='sentence'>
As far as we know Gaia is an unintentionally self-regulating system.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The larger forces driving the Earth systems don't care what happens.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia as a whole is incapable of making plans.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The necessary equipment simply is not there.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I find a strange and wild beauty in the midst of all that unguided complexity which is why I've picked up on the name "Gaia".

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Then, watching a cat stalking a bird, I can see that the ability to make plans came onto the scene long before human intelligence evolved.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The cat and I make plans because we are capable of intention.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our little individual organisms have the equipment required.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There doesn't need to be a static entity somehow producing intentions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The activity arises out of a huge collection of other activities, large and small.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We can't even begin to imagine how dynamic the whole thing is.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
And I say "thing" because our language is primitive; I know full well it isn't a "thing".

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Primitive thinking comes from an earlier time when we thought the world consisted of "things".

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It looked like objects were acting on objects, and maybe there was some supernatural super-object managing all the other objects.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But let's look closely.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There's nothing static about intentions.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The activity comes and goes.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
In silence I observe no self, including no observer.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Out of silence emerges self-activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We humans, with our intelligence, organizations, tools, machines, information, continuity and focus, are now capable of influencing the whole system.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
For better or for worse - and who decides what is "better", what is "worse"? We do.

I think we would be smart to take a close look at that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I want this, I don't want that, I want to be around people who want the same things I want.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Then there's always the next thing to want.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I wonder if I'm choosing this condition, or even choosing what it is I think I want.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Maybe all this wanting is a good thing, driving progress.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Maybe it's built into the evolutionary drive to survive.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It certainly doesn't make much sense to want to stop wanting.

</span>

<h3 id='c6-p1'>
P2: Integrity is a function of how well a system is integrated. Are any conflicting emotions currently creating instability in me? 

</h3>

<p id='c6-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
Not knowing what I want most of all creates conflicting emotions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A jumble of conflicting ideas about different possible directions can keep me stuck.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Too many choices can pull me first in this direction, then in that one, here's temporary success, here's abject failure, off in the distance is a shining star always receding.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I reject any of the conflicting emotions, I will be constantly off balance because that emotion will remain active underground.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I may become very convinced I've developed integrity, while ignoring parts of the system which will bite back.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A good way to reveal hidden conflicting emotions is to look closely at my judgments of other people.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's not a simple one to one correspondence, but there might be some sort of projection going on, and admitting it can be helpful in uncovering conflicting emotions in myself.

</span>

P3: The problem with living in a dream is that real people get hurt. What's my most recent example of that?  

</h3>

<p id='c6-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
We live in Gaia and we need to know Gaia in order to make accurate predictions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Dreams are simple minded expressions of our hopes and fears.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia is complex.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When we're awake we're able to listen to people who have their own dreams which sometimes clash with ours.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When I'm awake I can explore the difference between desire and intention.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can consider the difference between what I want to get, and what I want to do.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Whatever our intentions we need to keep in mind that Gaia is difficult for us to predict.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our preferences often do not match what is possible over the long haul.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
However, dreams can actually help us.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
After all, dreams would not even exist if they were not possible within Gaia's many systems.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I just need to be clear about what a dream is, and the difference between what I want to get, and what I want to do.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Intentions can be generous, can include the dreams of other people and consider a wider range of all kinds of information.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There is a gap between my dreams and the environment, including my body.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Dreams often reflect our impatience with physical processes.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We want to put on a cape and fly, rather than build an airplane.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Dreams can help us see what we deeply want, even in our sleep.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Awake, imagination can play freely, help us set intentions and experiment.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia will determine the outcome of the experiments.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Outcomes, though, are not predetermined because Gaia includes input from our dreams.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c6-p3'>
P4: If I'm not feeling my inner body right now, I'm not feeling anything. Take a moment to check in. 

</h3>

<p id='c6-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
We talk about our feelings a lot, but often they are mainly bound up in thoughts.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
To experience feeling states more precisely it helps to check in with physical sensations, especially those far away from our skin.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Instead of thinking about why we feel a certain way, we can pay attention to the raw data in the physical system.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
All through our body cells and organs are wanting something.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It seems like they even want attention, because when I give attention to the signals they are sending, everything calms down.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If there's a little gas pain in my belly, it will calm down and pass through more easily if I become quiet and listen.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
A sense of well-being gradually replaces the habitual hunger.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We are so lucky to live in a time and place that has us well-fed - why not just sit down for a few minutes and experience it? I find if I do that I can then tune into larger questions about what I want for myself and the world with far less anxiety than when I am ignoring the inner body.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c6-p4'>
P5: Since Gaia is what's real, any gap in honesty separates us. I can only be honest with myself if I listen to my whole self. How can I do that?

</h3>

<p id='c6-par10'>
<span class='sentence'>
I can only listen to my whole self if I honestly want to.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We sabotage ourselves by trying to do the impossible.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If I don't want to be honest with my whole self, I will only wear myself out pretending, or make up elaborate justifications about how I'm already doing just fine.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A very valuable clue is hidden in any sense of separation I'm experiencing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If I find that clue, I know I need to do something to be more in alignment with what is happening, and what will happen.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c6-par11'>
<span class='sentence'>
Of course I can never actually be separate from Gaia because all these processes, including my confusion, are connected to all the other processes surrounding me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A sense of separation indicates that what I want is not possible.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
One thing to look at is how much we think we want something that will happen in the future.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's much more accurate to look at what I'm experiencing right now that I want to get away from, as well as what I'm experiencing right now that I want more of.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Then I can move in the direction away from or toward those experiences while remaining open to new information, and acting on the basis of what is actually happening.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I imagine I want something, but honestly don't know what to do about it, I'm dreaming.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Honesty wakes me up.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c6-p5'>
P6: How much power do you think you have? How much do you want? How much does the other person have? How much do you think they want? 

</h3>

<p id='c6-par13'>
<span class='sentence'>
Power is the most elusive and undependable goal we can possibly imagine.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Think about it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The fact that it's such a common desire does not make it any more sane.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It makes people crazy.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It makes people corrupt.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The only healthy way to work with a desire for power is to first of all be honest with myself.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If I want it, I want it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I don't have to be ashamed of that.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
However, it might be helpful to examine what you think power is giving you, or would give you if you had more of it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Use other people you know or hear about in the media as a mirror.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What do they have that you want? In particular, do you think they have all the power they want, or do they act like they're trying to get more, and do they know where more will come from.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
In contemplating what you want, keep coming back to present experience because that's all you know for sure.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Even our memories are unreliable, especially our memories of something as elusive as power.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If you know you want more power, you can at least understand what it's supposedly going to do for you.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can tell you I feel a lot better since handing power over to Gaia.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c6-p6'>
P7: What am I being touched by right now, physically, emotionally, intellectually?

</h3>

<p id='c6-par15'>
<span class='sentence'>
I, as consciousness, am always being touched by the life processes of Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I want to know Gaia more because I feel limited and blocked in ways I don't understand, somehow separated from my own life processes.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation is my method.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
To contemplate what is touching me doesn't take time.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In a flash I can notice my contact with the person I'm talking with, how I'm being touched by that unique conversation, the flow of emotion, the hesitation, the glimmer of mystery.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I'm walking down the street and notice a current of loneliness, I can be touched by it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Of course I don't want pain.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I want pleasure.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's confusing though, because the possibility of pain can be exciting, like when I'm meeting someone I find attractive.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There is both potential pleasure and potential pain in meeting such a person.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia tells us there is no life without pain, and we want life.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
As I get more in touch with the elements of life, like the liquid touch of warm tea in my mouth, I instinctively see how to navigate pleasure and pain.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Too hot - ouch! Put the cup down.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Too cold - unappealing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's the same with everything.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We don't passively allow any and all kinds of touch.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In contemplation each touch can be unique with its own flavor.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We move toward what promotes life, and move away from harm.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Generations of individual organisms have been doing this for millions of years.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can trust my instincts, especially as my mind becomes less clouded by memories of past hurt and helplessness, and less fixated on images of what I think I want.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Fleeting connections, in all their richness, provide the nourishment I need.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c6-p7'>
P8: How does ideology creep into your thinking? What does it offer you? What does it take away from knowing Gaia? 

</h3>

<p id='c6-par17'>
<span class='sentence'>
Being a person is not easy.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We're definitely still in the experimental stages.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The balance between competition and cooperation, for example, is really tricky.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Do I want to be accepted, or do I want to win? One way to get both is to be a member of the conquering tribe, and joining a tribe can be as easy as agreeing with their ideas.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Also, consider our need to know, to be certain.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Ideology seems to offer a firm ground to stand on.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's all mixed up with values and beliefs.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The problem with beliefs is that fixating on a set of thoughts can blind us to the larger systems we depend on.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia has no beliefs and no values and we find that distasteful, even threatening.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We confuse indifference with hostility.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We want nature to value what we value.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So we pile belief upon belief declaring our values to be eternal truths.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
As part of getting to know Gaia I want to let go of ideology and hold beliefs lightly.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I don't want my identity tied to any particular set of thoughts, especially not thoughts about something called "Gaia".

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I want my values to be part of a living system, not depending on words set in stone.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c6-p8'>
P9: We're breathing, we're feeling the force of gravity. Paying attention to both at once places us squarely in the presence of Gaia. Try it. 

</h3>

<p id='c6-par19'>
<span class='sentence'>
To do this practice I have to set aside any motivation for gain.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being in the presence of Gaia has nothing to do with getting what I want, or doing what I want.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In order to sense that I'm not separate from the whole, I need to step away from preference for any of the parts.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This is easier than it sounds at first because actually the "parts" consist of concepts created in my own mind.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We are conditioned to experience division, but we don't have to be focused on that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Concepts can stand quietly in the background while we invite Gaia to come forward.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's helpful to set a time frame, maybe 10 minutes and be physically quiet, sitting comfortably.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There might be a kind of gap in your usual experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It might be very attractive, so now you want that gap.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Then there's a struggle, subtle or obvious, about trying to prefer no preference.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's why it helps to have something concrete to focus on, the breath, the feeling of gravity, as an anchor.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It can also be frightening, as though you're going to lose yourself.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
No, you won't, because Gaia is supporting you.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c6-p9'>
P10: Does Gaia have a self? What would that mean? 

</h3>

<p id='c6-par21'>
<span class='sentence'>
As our technology becomes more sophisticated and global, we are becoming Gaia's brain.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If we want to, we can become Gaia's self.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We can provide Gaia with values, with intelligent purpose.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If that's what we want to do, we first need to adjust our own identities.

P1: Since living systems do not exist independently in nature, what am I? What does that feel like?

</h3>

<p id='c7-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
Everything in Gaia is dynamic, always doing something.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That bare tree we see in the snow is not growing, but we can tell by looking at it if it is surviving.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If it is surviving, it is doing something to keep itself alive.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The same is true of my self-image.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
A dead tree can stand up for a while, but there's no such thing as a dead self-image.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If a self-image exists at all, it must be fed constantly.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It must be groomed all the time.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's changing all the time, too, but we don't notice.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We're captivated by the image of the moment.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There is visual memory connected to my self-image, and sometimes it's a bit of a shock to see myself in the mirror.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Who is that old person? Primarily, though, it's not a visual image, but a collection of concepts.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This dynamic collection of concepts is not easy to change by an act of will, but it will change itself if it is seen clearly.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p1'>
P2: Integrity is a function of how well a system is integrated. Are any conflicting emotions currently creating instability in me? 

</h3>

<p id='c7-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
When I glance in a mirror and see an old person there is a slight jolt of rejection.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There is a conflict between how I think of myself, based on the past, and how I look now.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Integrity demands that how I see myself in my mind's eye and what my body is doing right now are in synch.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Conflicting emotions can reveal cracks in my identity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What I look like is a small part of the process.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Conceptual self-image includes things I did in the past which I regret.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I might not talk about those things, or even think about them, but the memories linger.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Those memories are not like the husk of a dead tree, they are part of a living system, my identity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
While the dead tree in the forest has been colonized by fungus and other life forms, my memories of long past actions remain my own.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Allowing distasteful memories to surface into consciousness gives the self system the opportunity to work on integration.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Much of the work will take place outside our experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The narrow band of the spectrum I experience as "I am doing" doesn't need to be involved.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I don't know how unconscious forces work, but I do know that the system self-regulates as naturally as a tree drops leaves in winter.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Just the fact that I react emotionally to some memories as 'good' and some as 'bad' shows me that a selection process is at work.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Although I can't select what happened in the past, I can consider the future as open ground.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p2'>
P3: The problem with living in a dream is that real people get hurt. What's my most recent example of that? 

</h3>

<p id='c7-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams can reveal hidden dimensions of experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The emotional significance of memories can be seen full blown in dreams.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams contain valuable clues about our unconscious identity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Trouble begins when I become a character in my own dream, and make other people into dream companions or adversaries.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Sleep mostly keeps us safe.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being half-awake is dangerous.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We're not taking in enough information when we are half-awake.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our identity becomes very solid because it's not being challenged.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We might feel confident, stable, successful.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But if we are not integrated with Gaia, our dreams will collapse sooner or later.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When our identity is challenged it probably won't be pleasant, and the deeper we were in our own dream, the more unpleasant it will be.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It would be good to have some support from other people at that point, because what appears to be dysfunctional could be part of a very creative awakening.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But if other people are caught in their own dreams, and Gaia is being ignored, I'm on my own.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p3'>
P4: If I'm not feeling my inner body right now, I'm not feeling anything. Take a moment to check in. 

</h3>

<p id='c7-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
Identity depends on narrative, and most of what I feel is in reaction to a current narrative.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
In order to connect with my inner body, I need to step back from the narrative and pay attention to what we mistakenly label 'physical sensations'.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It is more accurate to label that level of feeling as 'my basic experience' because it can tell me much more about myself than any narrative.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Those so-called 'physical sensations' are a direct link with Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This is where identity begins, and it is where identity can change.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It is when we are able to slip beneath experience that feeling becomes truly creative.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
How can I feel something that I'm not experiencing? By dissolving the subject/object division.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When "I" am no longer feeling "my body" and yet awareness is actively sensing what is happening in the body, consciousness can expand into a sense of wholeness.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Identity becomes fluid and open for business, so to speak.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p4'>
P5: Since Gaia is what's real, any gap in honesty separates us. I can only be honest with myself if I listen to my whole self. How can I do that? 

</h3>

<p id='c7-par10'>
<span class='sentence'>
I can't listen to my whole self if I am insecure about my identity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Defensiveness and dishonesty are two sides of the same coin.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The way to disarm defensiveness is through compassion.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Guided by my desire to open to Gaia, I can open to myself in the privacy of my own mind.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I have the freedom to play whatever role I think I can handle in society, while in contemplation the mask can come off.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can admit my insecurities to myself and my friends while playing it safe with people I don't trust.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I don't have to pretend to be honest with everyone.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I develop the ability to be honest with everyone, well great, but let's not jump the gun.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Relying on my deepening contemplation practice, I can see myself losing my own attraction to pretense, and develop more sympathy for people who still need it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I don't think dishonesty is freely chosen.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I think it is a weapon picked up out of perceived necessity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We have a deep desire to connect, and you don't want to connect to a lie.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Still, the need for self preservation drives us into strange territory we would not enter unless we thought we had to.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
In contemplation identity can slip, and that isn't always a comfortable experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Let's be honest about that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia can help.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Thanks to science and technology I can watch a video describing cellular respiration.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Who needs to pretend to be something they are not when we're all sitting on cellular respiration! It's a miracle, a totally natural miracle, happening every moment in each one of our cells.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Although knowledge of cellular respiration is second hand and subject to change, it does tell me something about my whole self which inspires me to learn more.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p5'>
P6: How much power do you think you have? How much do you want? How much does the other person have? How much do you think they want? 

</h3>

<p id='c7-par12'>
<span class='sentence'>
The mystique of power closes identity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We can't take any chances.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The people who think I'm powerful are identifying with my story, but if those people knew the whole story, they would not be impressed.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Some parts of my story might make people feel sorry for me, and although maybe I could exploit that to manipulate a few people, that's not the self-image I want.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
You might think that power brings freedom to the individual, but I have to say it's just the opposite.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Since individual power depends entirely on fooling other people, you will need to keep fooling yourself.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Otherwise you won't be able to convince anyone else of your own importance.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Does that sound like freedom? To me it seems like some weird game of mutual tyranny.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In that game identity cannot naturally ebb and flow.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The person we think is powerful is depending on weapons and tools which can be taken away.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
They might not even feel their own fear as fear, but some other people will be able to see it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
In some species of animals there actually is an Alpha male or female.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Humans are too smart for that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Although we sometimes conveniently ignore this fact, our positions of dominance are fluid.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
No matter how powerful an individual appears now, we know that individual will die someday.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Not only that, we can think about all sorts of other ways individuals can lose power.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We've told stories on this topic from as far back as we can remember.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Some animals settle into a social hierarchy as though there's no tomorrow.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
For humans there's always tomorrow.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We have the capability to imagine the unexpected.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Unfortunately for those who desire power, the ability to imagine the unexpected detracts from our determination to hold onto current beliefs.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Allowing current beliefs to fade, like waking up from a dream, can dissolve our game of mutual tyranny.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Then we are available for opening identity in directions we haven't even imagined.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p6'>
P7: What am I being touched by right now, physically, emotionally, intellectually? 

</h3>

<p id='c7-par14'>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia is, above all else, a dynamic system.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Interaction is what keeps it going.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Concepts resist change.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We somehow developed the belief that the feeling of 'holding on' represents security.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In contemplation we begin to notice there is nothing to hold on to.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I think repeating the same words over and over gives me any kind of security, I'm going to miss out on the richness of life.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Common sense tells me that an appropriate response to current conditions is a more reliable form of security.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Before I can respond, however, I must form an accurate sense of what is touching me.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If that sense is based primarily on memory, I'm stuck in the past.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Intelligence demands more.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Yes, memory contains valuable information, but my mind wants to stretch and grow.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It may sound ironic, but in order to leave the past behind, we need to stop reaching for the future.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What's here now is touching us on so many different levels.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It doesn't take much time to stop and simply feel, we can do it with amazing swiftness.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
All that's required is the bravery to experience a gap in the process of identity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The gaps are there, always, and there's no profit in fearing them, while there is tremendous potential profit in an accurate assessment of what's happening.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Without any attempt to figure out anything in advance, we can simply stop and feel at our deepest levels.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
What a relief!

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p7'>
P8: How does ideology creep into your thinking? What does it offer you? What does it take away from knowing Gaia?

</h3>

<p id='c7-par16'>
<span class='sentence'>
No matter how hard I try I can never live up to the demands of an ideology.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Values are easy because I can see them in action.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Ideology exists as a set of ideals.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We may think our heroes are able to enact those ideals, but talk to that hero at 3 a.m.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
and you may witness some cracks in the persona.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Then you may turn against that person as a representation of failure, and feel better about yourself in comparison.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia, on the other hand, welcomes uncertainty and the creativity which goes along with it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
How do I know when I'm being compassionate? I may be just making excuses.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
How do I measure wisdom? It always depends upon a particular situation, so we can never draw the comparisons necessary for measurement.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Ideology requires group confirmation.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Otherwise, the collection of ideas just seems kind of crazy.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Within a group, crazy ideas can become the norm.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The group doesn't have to look like a group, as with people who idealize individualism.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There just needs to be an image of a superior person which is then reflected back to me through some medium.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Trying to live up to any image is a thankless task because I'm never quite there.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Much easier to see what's here, and what I value about it.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p8'>
P9: We're breathing, we're feeling the force of gravity. Paying attention to both at once places us squarely in the presence of Gaia. Try it. 

</h3>

<p id='c7-par18'>
<span class='sentence'>
Our most basic form of identity is "I am experiencing this".

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
With practice we can deliberately shrink attention from both "I am" and "this" to focus on "experiencing".

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That is the unabsorbed flow state.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There will still be conceptual judgments within the flow of experience, but they will be quick, easy and simple.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If I'm sitting quietly in the safety of my own living room, I don't need to make very many judgments.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I need to go to the bathroom, I get up and go to the bathroom.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I find it helpful, though, not to obey every impulse, because I am doing a deliberate practice.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If my mood starts to darken and I have an impulse to go to the kitchen to make a cup of tea, it's better to wait.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm curious about that shift in mood.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Generally it's like a cloud passing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It doesn't take much time and it doesn't have much impact.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That's good to know.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I don't have to either run from or chase moods.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
On the other hand, if I've left something burning on the stove, immediate action is required.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If something more complicated is bothering me, like needing to earn money, it will probably take over my mind and it doesn't help to try to focus too much away from it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Since breathing is always happening, and the force of gravity doesn't go away, I can practice just being quiet with the whole thing for awhile, and then do something to solve my problem.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia informs me that individual identity is not a problem as long as I'm experiencing breath and gravity, I don't have to prove anything about myself.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c7-p9'>
P10: Does Gaia have a self? What would that mean? 

</h3>

<p id='c7-par20'>
<span class='sentence'>
The Sun is sending out energy and Gaia is receiving it and using it to do work.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There could not be a more perfect love, and yet neither system has had the capability to know that.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Until now.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We are not separate from these systems which are giving rise to our existence moment by moment.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
And we have somehow developed the capability to know something about what's happening.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Because we're still in the early days of this development we don't quite believe in it yet.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We are mesmerized by our own imaginations at the cost of conscious connection with that which gives us life.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We know we are going to die, we know it's possible that all humans could die in a chain reaction to one cataclysmic event, and that knowledge is too much for us right now, with our limited identities.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Yet we are smart enough to invent technology which can bring about the very death which we fear.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We are smart enough to destroy our own environment.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Are we smart enough to change our behavior before it's too late? Gaia can't do it for us, we have to grow up and do it for Gaia.

</p><h2 id='c8'>Ch 8. ~  Being and doing</h2>
<h3 id='c8-p0'>
P1: Since living systems do not exist independently in nature, what am I? What does that feel like? 

</h3>

<p id='c8-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
The more firmly I am established in my sense of being, the less I have to prove by doing, or not doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia is doing the heavy lifting, always.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
A few billion years ago cellular metabolism and replication joined forces, and we are still riding that wave.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I'm not on the wave, I'm in the wave, an integral part of it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Whatever I do is an expression of that wave of life.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can take a few minutes and deliberately not do anything, and the wave sweeps on.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Taking a few minutes in a quiet place to deliberately 'just be' I notice that thinking goes on.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There are varying degrees of experiencing thinking as something I'm doing or as something that is happening autonomously like breathing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There are other actions which are more autonomous than breathing, for example the stomach processing food.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Breathing, I can decide to take a quick short breath or a long slow breath.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Thinking is rather like that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I don't depend on thinking as much as I used to, so I notice long pauses in the stream of thoughts.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Those pauses help me become more aware of the feeling of being here.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There's a feedback loop from the feeling of being here which undermines watching myself be here.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Watching myself be here is a form of grasping which relaxes as I notice I don't need to make myself be here.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I get hungry, I will eat.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm lucky to be living in a situation with food easily available.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
While I'm cooking or cleaning up I'm in harmony with the people in the background who produce the food and keep water flowing from the faucet.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Some of those people might be having a hard time.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Contemplation broadens my concerns; it's not supposed to make me blindly happy.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c8-p1'>
P2: Integrity is a function of how well a system is integrated. Are any conflicting emotions currently creating instability in me? 

</h3>

<p id='c8-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
As being and doing become more integrated, my motivation for doing anything becomes more grounded in actual needs rather than superficial wants.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If my goals are unrealistic it means I'm out of touch with being.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
'Being' refers not only to my own basic existence, but to the nature of the systems I'm part of.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The nature of these systems guide what I'm doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Remember that Gaia is self-regulating.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
As I'm part of Gaia, I'm being regulated by Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If I'm trying to do something difficult, the level of that difficulty has been set by Gaia, not by me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So I have to first of all pay attention to how I'm feeling.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If I'm feeling good, that indicates some integrity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But that good feeling might be coming out of some fantastic story I'm telling myself.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I may be integrated within my own mind, but if the story I'm believing conflicts with the facts of other systems, there is no real stability.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So I have to look beyond my own mind for a wider integrity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What I see might cause some conflicting emotions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I might feel very good making myself a delicious breakfast with eggs.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
So far, so good.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But if I happen to see pictures of how most chickens are living, I might find it revolting enough to stop buying eggs and miss my favorite breakfast.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The system was stable until I was exposed to new information.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Something in my being responded to the quality of life implied by the pictures of the chickens, and changed what I wanted to do.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The amount of suffering in the life of all beings on a global scale is frightening.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Stories of children in refugee camps, pictures of rainforests burning, can produce overwhelming feelings of helplessness.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Is life on earth some crazy accident? Is it all a bad dream? When I return to my more basic experience of being alive, my breathing, any tension around the eyes, comfort in the gut, these physical sensations I usually ignore, I am led into an awareness of basic being which wordlessly answers my questions.The ability to vividly remember something from the past has been given to us by Gaia as yet another survival tool.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But as with any tool, it must be used correctly.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If used incorrectly, people can be injured.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Unfortunately in our current culture we are not well educated in the uses and misuses of memory.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Living in memories is just like living in a dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We are not available to the immediate incoming information which is constantly changing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We live in memories when we believe that those images of the past represent who we are now.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That doesn't mean we should ignore memories.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Even the most simple animals depend upon memories in order to respond in the present.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I don't know what it's like to be a simple animal, but I do know that self-image is important to humans.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Memories get tangled up in that self-image, and we believe it must survive intact.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
People who would exploit us know how to make use of our social instinct to preserve a self-image.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We can free ourselves from their influence by realizing that our memories are there to be used as a guide to action, not to tell us who we are.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I am sitting quietly, remembering nothing, I am fully myself.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Nothing is missing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I get hungry and need to find the refrigerator, memory will serve me well.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Some memories from high school are probably best forgotten.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I'm still fully who I am right now.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c8-par5'>
<span class='sentence'>
P3: The problem with living in a dream is that real people get hurt.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
What's my most

</span>
</p>

<p id='c8-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
recent example of that?

</span>
</p>

<p id='c8-par7'>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams drift around somewhere between being and doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
They remind us of how much happens in the realm of the subconscious brain.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
They are a creative force between the certainty of being and the uncertainty of doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
They are immaterial and yet can have unpredictable influences on what happens in the material world.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Artistic expression can be seen as a manifestation of a dream state.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I watch a movie I'm joining a large group of creators in a group dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
None of those creators are likely to know what that dream means to me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
They don't know how successful they will be in persuading me to believe something is possible, when it's not.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
A man singing a song, surrounded by skilled musicians who easily awaken buried emotion, have no idea how they can change my life by changing my dreams.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A group of people caught in a conspiracy theory which is essentially a bad dream can change an election, casting a shadow over the rest of us.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c8-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
P4: If I'm not feeling my inner body right now, I'm not feeling anything.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Take a moment to check in.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c8-par9'>
<span class='sentence'>
You touch the opposite of existential angst by not avoiding it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our thoughts connect to the biochemistry of the nervous system.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Often when we're not thinking of anything in particular a thought pops up about a problem that needs to be solved.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our biochemistry shifts away from simply being to doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But how many thoughts do we have about problems which we are in no position to solve? Speaking for myself, a lot.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
With biochemistry poised for action, and no relevant action available, we go for the irrelevant.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Confusion and anxiety are the result.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Rather than trying to avoid that state, it is possible to recognize it fully and then have the motivation to simply halt the train.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The train will slow down as I direct attention to the inner body.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can remind myself that conscious being is an alternative to doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If this is a deficiency in my earlier education, it's important to learn about it through my own experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The countless mechanisms of the interlocking systems of Gaia are keeping me alive at this moment.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Not forever, but that's in the future.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I'm here now.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What's it like to just be here? You might find your experience expanding, taking in all sorts of subtle perceptions and a recognition of the deep unity in everything which is happening.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There is an unexplainable happiness in the dynamic quality of being.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There is nothing passive about it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
You are not being subjected to anything.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
You are not less alive than when you are doing something.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
You don't need to seize upon some problem solving activity in order to justify your existence.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If you want to help people, try passing along permission to experience basic being.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There are countless ways to communicate this attitude, but first of all you must know it thoroughly in your direct experience.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c8-p2'>
P5: Since Gaia is what's real, any gap in honesty separates us. I can only be honest with myself if I listen to my whole self. How can I do that? 

</h3>

<p id='c8-par11'>
<span class='sentence'>
For a few minutes stop choosing your thoughts and see what comes up.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Then if a bad or crazy thought comes up you're not responsible because you did not choose it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
You didn't do it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It just happened.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
And, being a self-regulating system, you won't act on that bad thought because you know it is bad and you don't want the consequences of acting on it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Whatever bad or crazy thoughts drift through my mind are not who I am.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The being that I am is what the thoughts - good, bad, irrelevant - pass through.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being itself is not changed.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
All kinds of clouds gather and blow and drift through the sky.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
To acknowledge my own thoughts is the beginning of honesty.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
To experience very strong emotions while doing nothing tells me something about where my actions are coming from.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A self-regulating system is not necessarily a mechanical, deterministic system.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
My refrigerator is a mechanical, deterministic system which does a good job of keeping my food cold.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But it's not smart enough to know if there's any food in it needing to be kept cold.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It will keep going regardless.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When our human system is functioning well, we know the difference between thinking about helping or hurting someone, and taking the action necessary to do the helping or hurting.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Often when we hurt someone we don't do it deliberately, but as a result of unconscious forces.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The more honest I am with myself, the more those unconscious forces will reveal themselves.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Intelligent action requires information, and nothing gives me more important information than being honest with myself.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c8-p3'>
P6: How much power do you think you have? How much do you want? How much does the other person have? How much do you think they want?

</h3>

<p id='c8-par13'>
<span class='sentence'>
Insecure about our possession of power, we cling to familiar thoughts.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The need for power is an old, old human thought.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
All our ancient thoughts about gods, angels and demons reflect our desperation to exert control.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our modern investigations based on science seem to result in more control, so more of us are following science, abandoning the old gods.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Yet the confusion goes on, blocking our access to the experience of being.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Power is all about doing, who is doing what, who is influencing others, how we can join with others to amplify our personal power.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We might believe that power is somehow embedded in being, that some people are just naturally more powerful than others.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We notice that some public figures have charisma, some magical quality which makes them attractive to large numbers of people.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What are they doing to create that charm? If I'm not in touch with basic being I can easily believe that those people don't have to do anything to hold onto power.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I might even believe that about myself because I seem to lead a charmed life.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's why it's so important to investigate the difference between being and doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I'm embedded in a series of systems and those systems are giving me life.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can control bits and pieces of the network of systems, but I can't control the whole thing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can only do so much, and then I depend on other forces.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Being doesn't need to know what it is depending on .

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being doesn't need to possess any particular form.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's happening - period.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
As we get in touch with being we realize that it isn't a 'thing'.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
And neither is it an activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Weird, huh? There's no way to explain it, yet we are all experiencing it right now and at every moment.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We prefer to ignore it, keep it way in the background, because we are fixated on our preferences and how to maintain the forms we prefer.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being is formless, potentially all forms equally.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
My human form doesn't have any more or less being than your human form.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The forms have different capabilities, and we are naturally concerned about that because we have to take care of our individual survival and advancement.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It makes us nervous to rest in being because we know we can't trust it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It doesn't favor our present, temporary form.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It doesn't care about our desire for power.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c8-p4'>
P7: What am I being touched by right now, physically, emotionally, intellectually? 

</h3>

<p id='c8-par15'>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation is 'doing' reaching for 'being'.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's for people who want to be more in touch.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Often we confuse grasping with touch.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There's too much doing in grasping.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Allowing ourselves to be touched, we can see there's no need to hold on to one particular touch.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Contact is coming at us from every different direction on every different level.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can begin with air.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Can I feel the air touching me? Is it cold or warm? Is it comfortably drawn through my nose and throat? Emotions are a different kind of experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Is anything bothering me emotionally right now? What about intellectually - is the idea of contemplation making sense? Exactly how does an idea touch us? Isn't touch always physical? Emotion certainly has a physical component.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I'm angry my whole body is in a state of anger.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But emotions also involve the mind, which is not physical.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Some ideas touch us emotionally with the excitement of disagreement or happy airgreement.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But some ideas touch only the mind, and it is important to learn to see how that works.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Because the mind is not physical we confuse it with being.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Here's the difference: being is unconditioned, mind is conditioned.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
An idea which touches the mind is part of the process of conditioning.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Just as icy air stinging the nose conditions me to come inside where it's warm, an idea like Gaia conditions me to seek certain kinds of information and see the world in a certain way.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Maybe the idea of being is touching you right now.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Maybe it strikes you (touch!) as vague and irrelevant to your life.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Maybe it seems elusive yet something you want to dig into.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This practice says to simply notice how it's touching you.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Then notice how the chair you're sitting on is touching you.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
You know you don't need to hold on to the chair.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It continues to support you effortlessly, that's just what it does.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
You're invited in this contemplation to try just sitting in the chair, touched by a flow of emotions, touched by a flow of thoughts.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being is ungraspable, but it is touching you always, at the core of every form.

</span>

P8: How does ideology creep into your thinking? What does it offer you? What does it take away from knowing Gaia?

</h3>

<p id='c8-par17'>
<span class='sentence'>
Blaming people for their actions is based on an ideology of separation.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It is a grandiose idea connected to our desire for praise.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Unfortunately it is not possible to have praise without the possibility of blame.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
To blame myself for doing something stupid is to ignore the painstaking step by step method by which Gaia has formed this web of life.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
During photosynthesis some chloroplasts have the choice to move across the cell toward the light or, if it's too intense, away from it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's easy for them to do the right thing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's not easy for us.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
And so we create ideologies to share and to guide us.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Any ideology, not just an ideology of individualism, ignores the clay from which we are constantly being formed.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If we are loyal to a set of ideas we can't risk observing our own limitations which include the limitations of knowing who is right.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We can't float in the ocean of being.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We have to vigilantly maintain our tunnel vision against all the evidence which says it isn't helping us.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I've never consciously chosen an ideology.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I've gravitated toward certain points of view and gradually I become enmeshed in an ideology with other people.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's never been individual.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's possible to be attached to a unique and lonely idea, but that's not what I need to contemplate because I haven't done that.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What I have done is join groups, partly because of shared ideas but mostly because of chance encounters and attractions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Knowing Gaia, knowing I don't choose my limitations, frees me from attempting to escape from my limitations through ideology.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This freedom, rather than the freedom to choose what to do, opens the window to the emptiness of being.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c8-p6'>
P9: We're breathing, we're feeling the force of gravity. Paying attention to both at once places us squarely in the presence of Gaia. Try it. 

</h3>

<p id='c8-par19'>
<span class='sentence'>
In Gaia there is no separation between being and doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Breath and gravity are not in opposition.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When I'm asleep I breathe without knowing it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gravity keeps me on the bed while I'm lost in a dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Although we've never left Gaia (that would be impossible) we are distracted by evolution's shiny new toy, the human mind and all its inventions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Returning to the breath is returning to the basics of life.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Noticing gravity we are in the company of everything.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When a shark locks onto the scent of a prey animal, it doesn't have to do much in order to be successful.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Sharks have been perfecting this behavior for about 450 million years.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We get confused.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Do I want this? Do I want that? Did I hurt my friend when I said that? Will it help to say this? Or maybe I secretly want to hurt this so-called friend who has neglected me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our lives are complex and we need all our intelligence.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We don't want to return to the world of sharks, and we can't.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Misguided motivation can squander our energy.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Acting in contact with being is straightforward action.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being is not some mysterious force we need to get hold of.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It is what we share with everything.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It is the potential, the empty cup which accepts tea, soup or poison with equal graciousness.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Nature never agreed to present us only with food, but has given us the ability to distinguish food from poison.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Even when simply sitting with breath and gravity we are enjoying the challenge of insight into our own hidden beliefs and wishful thinking.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Otherwise it would be better to take a nap.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Sometimes I wake up from a nap with fresh insight.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Yet there is something special about going into a deeply restful state while fully conscious, and not attempting to produce something non-ordinary.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If you want to see your mind in a non-ordinary state there are some very good drugs you can take.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I've had some interesting trips myself, back in the day.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Breath and gravity are the most ordinary things imaginable.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Ordinary might sound dull if we confuse it with mindless habitual activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But when I give it my heartfelt attention it is anything but dull.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When being and doing are not separate, freshness and a profound richness pervade all our experience, from the most simple to the most complex.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c8-par20'>
<span class='sentence'>
P10: Does Gaia have a self? What would that mean?

</span>
</p>

<p id='c8-par21'>
<span class='sentence'>
Our lives depend on photosynthesis and we can't do it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We depend on plants, and they benefit from our ability to recycle carbon.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia figured this out a long time ago.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
To us it seems like a clever system designed by someone.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But we haven't been able to find the designer.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The whole thing just seems to be purely natural, which means no division between being and doing.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In our language there is nothing artificial about the elaborate process of using light to create food.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If humans manage to invent a process of inorganic photosynthesis, we will call it artificial.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We will say we did it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Some people would then say that the process of inorganic photosynthesis arose completely naturally from the vast potentiality of being.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We would agree, on an intellectual level, but would we feel that in our bones? When I'm in a plane hurtling down the runway and then lifting off, what I feel is an amazement that we are able to do this.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Grateful that once again, it worked.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It doesn't feel natural.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It has a beauty which is quite different from the beauty of the bird lifting off from the tree branch outside my window.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Atmospheric carbon dioxide a few days ago passed 416 parts per million.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We can't live with that on a long term basis.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We have to do something unnatural.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We have to consciously assume responsibility for our own ecosystem.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
One of the key concepts of Gaia is that organisms affect their environment.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So there's nothing new about that.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What is new is the ability to say "Wait a minute.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We need a plan."

<h3 id='c9-p0'>
P1: Since living systems do not exist independently in nature, what am I? What does that feel like? 

</h3>

<p id='c9-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
When thoughts quiet down a space opens up which feels not just vast but unlimited.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We don't need to make that into something, to give it a significance it doesn't actually have.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's so tempting to believe that death is not real, that we go on and on in different forms.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Well, maybe we do, I don't know.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I just know how important it is to acknowledge the limitations of my current experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The simple experience of being alive, which is so wonderful, is limited to being alive.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
All emotions are arising from current conditions, which are always changing.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I try to hold onto any particular feeling state, I'm blocking a fuller experience of what's here now.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I will never understand myself if I refuse to be fully what I am right now.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When those futile efforts to stick to what I prefer start to fade away, it's such a relief! Yes, I do want to be happy, but there is something so much better than happiness, and that is to be appropriately aligned with what is happening.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
To do that, I must be as supple as a pine tree in the wind.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can't be in the wind and out of it at the same time.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can remember what it's like to be in a quiet, windless snowfall, that's part of being human.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But let's not overdo the memories, the predictions, the desires.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Within the limits of current conditions, I can be in contact with what exists around me, and it is enough.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c9-p1'>
P2: Integrity is a function of how well a system is integrated. Are any conflicting emotions currently creating instability in me?

</h3>

<p id='c9-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
My desire for stability has led me into a lot of rigid thinking.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Trying to find something solid and dependable has blocked me from the unabsorbed flow state which is what I really want.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Being afraid of my own limitations has kept me in a soup of conflicting emotions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Wanting stability, I didn't recognize that Gaia demands dynamic integrity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
How does a system remain integrated when everything, outside and inside, is moving? How does a pine tree remain a pine tree on a windy day or through a heavy snowfall? First, it is flexible.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It doesn't argue with the wind.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It sheds the snow by bending and letting gravity do the work.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Ancestral pine trees were shaped by wind and snow.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If a pine tree has a weak limb and it snaps off in a storm, the tree itself adjusts to the loss.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Humans are obviously much more complex than pine trees, especially since so much of our integrity resides in the mind.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Because so much of what happens in the mind doesn't appear to be physical, we have gravitated toward identification with thoughts as much as with physical form.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our conscious links with what we call physical have weakened, and this has weakened the integrity of the whole system.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When I relax my fixation on words, attention can be more flexible.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I'm talking with someone and deliberately open my senses to the sound of their voice, facial expressions, posture and so on, I gain a much better sense of that person's integrity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can see what we share and what we don't share.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I think my compassion is unlimited, I'm treading on unreliable ground.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
At some point my own integrity will demand that I close the door.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia is composed of individual organisms related to each other.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When I die, you can continue to live.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I want you to! No, I'm probably not going to lay down my life for you, but it makes me feel good to know that when I go down, I'm not taking everything with me.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The integrity of life around me maintains itself through constant change.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
At some point life on earth will end.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's all the more reason to take care of it while we can.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I notice I have some conflicting emotions I can ask myself what might help me be more resilient, more adaptable, more in harmony with Gaia.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c9-p2'>
P3: The problem with living in a dream is that real people get hurt. What's my most recent example of that? 

</h3>

<p id='c9-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
When imagination gets tangled up in personal hopes and fears we see other people through that lens.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We are limited by imagining how this person could help me or that person is frustrating.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
At that point we are living in a dream world, missing the complexity of real time interactions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We did not invent this world, it was forced upon us.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Remembering the dreams I had last night can help me understand the causes of the emotional haze which binds me to the past.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The clear potential of basic being is limited when old hurts and memories of happiness capture our attention.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Emotion is supposed to motivate us to protect ourselves and work on enhancing our lives.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The problem is a lack of coordination.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams arise from our primordial memories which is why they can be so emotionally rich yet weirdly irrational.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Emotion tied to dreams is heavy, ponderous.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Awake, our emotions are light, able to dance in a world of constant change.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Memories are useful, but we can see their limits when we are awake.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can savor the intensity of dreams with no need to analyze them, because they already told me what I needed to know.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
To get more in touch with basic being I need to expand identification by contacting what is here now.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can be liberated from my dreams without killing them.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Within my natural limits I can work on coordinating past, present and future.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can be open to surprises.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can trust myself to respond creatively to a world of change, rather than dreaming of being a person who never makes mistakes.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Dreams which promised me freedom from limitations only slammed me up against other people who inconveniently refused to be part of my dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's much better to include all those people in who I think I am.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Random encounters can take me out of my dreams and into Gaia where dreams are one more little piece of a much bigger picture.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c9-p3'>
P4: If I'm not feeling my inner body right now, I'm not feeling anything. Take a moment to check in.

</h3>

<p id='c9-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
Emotions are brewing in the inner body all the time.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I might think I'm happy because I'm looking at someone I love, and that's true to some extent, but I'm probably ignoring the physical pathways which are doing the work of producing the feelings.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Because we believe the body to be the source of limitations, we don't want to hear what it is attempting to communicate throughout our entire field of experience.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There's good reason to make a deliberate practice aimed at turning this attitude around.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Going back to the example of looking at someone I love, when I am more fully in tune with the inner body, it's like hearing a beautiful piece of music.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The complexity of messages coming from the region around the heart, and the relaxation deep in the gut, is of a very different quality from the complexities of thought.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Each strand of emotion running through the body is simple and pure, even though the various strands may differ in tone.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A strand of disappointment can run right alongside a strand of gratification.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In my thoughts, all this complexity can easily become a muddle.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I want to know which feeling is truly 'how I feel' about this person.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The more adept I become at tuning into the inner body, the more compassion I find arising naturally along with the rest of the complexity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The way to practice is to choose a moment which is relatively simple, and listen to the messages coming from the body with affection and trust.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm not trying to reform myself as I do this, and I most certainly am not trying to get past any perceived limitations.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I'm in pain, it's like my body is screaming at all the natural limitations of life.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
So I need to practice while I am not in any unusual pain.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There is always some pain in the body from past hurts, some constriction.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
As I notice that, I do not try to relax.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Trying to relax is not the same as listening, and this is primarily a listening practice.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Trying to heal is also a barrier to more deeply experiencing whatever it is we think needs to heal.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There are other methods for healing, and of course we will make use of whatever we think will help us.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This practice is for those times when we can afford to be quiet.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c9-p4'>
P5: Since Gaia is what's real, any gap in honesty separates us. I can only be honest with myself if I listen to my whole self. How can I do that? 

</h3>

<p id='c9-par10'>
<span class='sentence'>
Trying to be honest is severely limited if it includes an unfriendly accusation of dishonesty.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This brings up a natural defensiveness, including self-deception.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's why I need to keep coming back to contemplation with an attitude of friendly acceptance and no particular goal.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Instead of holding a predetermined goal, we practice in the openness of potential.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There is room for both acceptance and preference.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Yes, it is tricky.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It demands practice.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Above all, contemplation requires interest.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's how I can listen to my whole self; I'm extremely interested.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I'm lucky to be living in a time and place which allows me to do this.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can imagine doing contemplation practice in a refugee camp, but I can't say I would be able to.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Maybe? I don't know.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This statement, "I don't know" comes up a lot as I learn to be more honest with myself.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If it feels like "I don't know and I don't care" I'm suspicious of the motivation.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Probably I don't want the pain of caring.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I value caring, so I prefer the kind of "I don't know" which does care, but acknowledges my limitations.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I don't know what it would be like to be in a refugee camp, but the pictures of children in the ads soliciting donations make me shudder.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The ads don't, however, make me send money.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Can I be honest about why I don't send money? When I begin to explain myself, I have to stop because it's so obvious I don't know why I don't send money and I don't know what other people should be doing about the problem.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
And I really enjoyed my dinner tonight.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c9-p5'>
P6: How much power do you think you have? How much do you want? How much power does the other person have? How much do you think they want? 

</h3>

<p id='c9-par12'>
<span class='sentence'>
Power and meaning depend upon each other.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A person without power is a person without meaning.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia refuses to give me any meaning and I'm learning to appreciate that freedom.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
My search for meaning now looks to me like a futile attempt to explain all the contradictory impulses I find within myself, and then to feel good about the whole mess.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
With that accomplished my naked desire for control could become something mystical and admirable, almost worthy of worship.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
After all, this desire for control, for dominance, includes the impulse to protect what I love.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When I have a strong sense that something is deeply meaningful, that sense is coming from the unlikely joining together of opposing forces like love and hate.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The energy is explosive.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
You become convinced that the energy is yours.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If you're suddenly able to accomplish something, or show some leadership, the excitement can be addictive, and it will attract other people, which is even more addictive.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Remember though, that the energy is coming from the harnessing together of contradictory impulses.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The horses pulling the chariot at any given moment might be praise and blame.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
They might be fear of blame and hope for praise.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
They might be love and the fear of losing love.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Or the desire to prove yourself worthy of love, and confusion about how to do that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The system of concepts employed to make ourselves seem sometimes heroic, sometimes a victim, is necessarily based on beliefs and interpretations driven by overheated emotion.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's a rickety system.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia is not a rickety system.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c9-p6'>
P7: What am I being touched by right now, physically, emotionally, intellectually? 

</h3>

<p id='c9-par14'>
<span class='sentence'>
Every relationship we encounter, moment by moment, opens up into the network we call Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
As I pick up a spoon, I'm being touched by minerals which were mined somewhere on Earth.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I don't know where.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can feel the weight of the spoon, the smoothness.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This is a piece of the natural world.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Someone designed this particular spoon, in line with a long history of spoons.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's useful, it's pleasant to see and to handle.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There is artifice here, as well as natural material.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Human design and manufacture is as closely woven into the network of life as is the metal which formed in the Earth.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The people who worked in the mine and the factory needed to eat.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That food was another part of a long chain of relationships.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
All along the chain there are natural limits.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm using this spoon to eat some oatmeal.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
A limited amount of oats can be grown, and I'm lucky to have some of them.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I'm tasting the oatmeal, feeling the texture in my mouth, how the oatmeal settles easily into my stomach.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The way Gaia works is that countless small relationships radiate outward, touching in all directions.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Each component, everything that touches me, is limited.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The number of possible relationships is practically unlimited.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Recently I was looking at some pictures from Mars.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There had been an upgrade in the resolution of images beamed from a rover, so the pictures were more vivid than any I had seen before.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The pictures touched me strongly.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Yes, we have barren, rocky places on Earth, but I knew, or believed, that these pictures showed what it is like on Mars.

<span class='sentence'>
Through our machinery, Gaia has jumped to Mars! Of course the machinery has gone far beyond Mars, flying beyond our solar system, but the Mars rover is actually touching the substance of Mars, driving itself around and beaming pictures back to us.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It struck me as momentus that Gaia could touch the stuff of Mars, and I could see pictures of it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I felt so proud to be human, to be part of this system which has taken Gaia beyond Earth.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This spoon, the oatmeal, the bowl, these familiar objects don't seem as momentus, yet they do touch me, and they are part of this same system.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
As our human touch reaches out into space it's good to remember that oats depend on specific conditions to grow here on Earth, and those of us who like our oatmeal had better guard those conditions, even as we are moved by pictures of the stark beauty of rocks on Mars.

P8: How does ideology creep into your thinking? What does it offer you? What does it take away from knowing Gaia?

</h3>

<p id='c9-par16'>
<span class='sentence'>
No emotion, anger, joy, pride, wants to hang out with uncertainty.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The emotions are fine mixing it up with each other, like colors in a painter's box, or chords on a piano.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In fact, it takes an artist to express all the shades of hot or cold anger, longing which is playful and somewhat joyful, or extremely sad.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
What all these emotions have in common is a need for a cause.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Ideology provides us with a 'cause' in every sense of the word.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Ideology can tell me exactly why I'm angry and if I'm justified or guilty to feel the way I do.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Ideology can provide me with a program to change the way I feel, or promote it by joining a 'cause' with others who feel similarly.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Emotion loves an agenda because it now has a future.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Having the reassurance of a future, emotion can soften, lose the sharp edge of present naked feeling.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia is full of surprises.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's never quite clear what is causing what.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The future is not assured.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If I can recognize the natural limits of ideology then I'm not trapped in it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Seeing for myself how emotion tends to get itself trapped in a tangle of ideas can help my system find what it really needs, by being more in alignment with the larger system, with Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia apparently has no objection to the people I hate, because there they are, alive and well.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Unlike certain other gods, Gaia has no plans to send anyone to hell.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Not the people I hate, not me for hating them.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I like my ideas, those people like their ideas.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Our disagreement need not blow up our world.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Time will tell which ideas flourish and which fade.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Maybe the people I don't like are right now in the process of inheriting the earth.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Oh, well.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I might want to loosen up my preferences.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I might want to be less sure about who is causing what, and focus more on the effects as they are happening right now.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There's nothing wrong with looking for patterns and probabilities, nothing wrong with caring about the future, but it does not help to over simplify or indulge in wishful thinking.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
My emotions are getting used to hanging out in uncertainty, and they are all the more lively for doing so.

</span>

P9: We're breathing, we're feeling the force of gravity. Paying attention to both at once places us squarely in the presence of Gaia. Try it.

</h3>

<p id='c9-par18'>
<span class='sentence'>
Sometimes when I do this practice I feel like I could easily lose my motivation for doing any sort of work.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can see that so much of my effort comes from trying to be something I'm not.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Just sitting, not listening to all the propaganda of culture and self, breathing, feeling gravity, I wonder why I would want to do anything else.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That's dangerous, right? Well, I've done it enough now to know that it's much less dangerous than a lot of the things I do which are considered normal and perfectly safe, but just happen to be destroying our environment.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I've done this practice enough to learn how restful it is, and to experience how rest has natural limits.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Life is a flow of energy.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Humans, unfortunately, have become addicted to unhealthy amounts of stimulation.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We also exploit each other as workers, and become dependent on other people working too much, or in unhealthy ways.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If we look to the pre-human world we can observe how other life forms have been shaped by sustainable energy flows.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Sparrows would destroy the earth through their greed just as surely as we would, but they are a more simple form of life, and more easily kept within limits.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
To be in the presence of Gaia is to learn who we naturally are.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
We are not naturally lazy, far from it! We can afford to take some time in silence.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
For just a few minutes, as an experiment, drop all the stimulation which is supposed to be so entertaining, informative, relaxing or whatever, and come home to breath, gravity and the vast potential of basic being.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Most likely you will not decide to starve, even if you do quit your present job in order to better enjoy the only life you will ever have.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c9-p9'>
P10: Does Gaia have a self? What would that mean? 

</h3>

<p id='c9-par20'>
<span class='sentence'>
Self is a system in a world of other self-systems.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If Gaia were all there is, there would be no need for Gaia to have a self.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In the history of life, as soon as there were organisms with boundaries, metabolism and replication, there was competition for resources.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The organisms that got the food were the organisms which reproduced.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It all took place within the natural limits of the non-living environment, but you wouldn't say that the non-living environment of rocks, water, air, sunlight was in any way competing with Gaia as the web of life grew.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Now, thanks to humans, Gaia does have non-living competition in the form of machines.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Machines which gobble up fossil fuels can't destroy Gaia, but they can seriously upset the balance of nature.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Machines producing nuclear energy can make water, air and rocks poisonous to most living organisms.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Our common understanding of 'nature' means life and the physical substrate supporting it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When we want to go for a walk in nature, we might walk along a river.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But we probably don't stand on a bridge over an interstate highway admiring the traffic.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
As organic systems ourselves, we need to be on the side of Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Yet we depend on our machines.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
How many people do you know who never use a car, or a bus, never buy food trucked in from the farm? Some of us are conscientious enough to buy cars which use less fuel, but our current choices are limited.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If we were to consciously become a self for Gaia, rather than a slave to our machines, we could create a symbiosis.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Our machines could support us as we created a symbiosis which promoted life systems and technology at the same time.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
There would still be competition for resources because the earth is limited.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Maybe we can consciously control our own greed and aggression in support of Gaia.

</p><h2 id='c10'>Ch 10. ~  Self-regulating systems and individual choice</h2>
<h3 id='c10-p0'>
P1: Since living systems do not exist independently in nature, what am I? What does that feel like?

</h3>

<p id='c10-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
Our bodies need to be able to regulate their own water content.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
How do they do that? As you would expect, it's very complicated.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Physiologists can describe a lot of what is happening, but you need to know more about the properties of the water molecule than I do to even begin to talk about it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
So let's just agree that organisms for millions of years have successfully regulated their water content without thinking about it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
At a certain point, I, as an individual, experience thirst.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Then what.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Do I have beer in the fridge? Do I reach for one? Do I have sparkling water imported from Italy? Do I want to drink some? Do I start the water kettle to make myself some herbal tea? Or do I just pick up a glass and turn on the tap.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Consider how these conditions have developed.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
These days when I'm in the supermarket I don't even look at the shelves of soft drinks.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Or the potato chips which go so beautifully with the sodas.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
(I do remember!) Obviously lots of other people are buying the stuff or there wouldn't be so much of it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I think of my friends and what they drink, I can't think of a single person who stocks up on soda at the grocery store.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Therefore, when they're thirsty, soda is not an option.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This tells me that my choice to drink soda, or not, is related to who I am socially.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This is all leading up to the question of how I experience individual choice.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I know that who I think I am has a lot to do with making choices.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I know I never choose to be thirsty.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I am or I'm not.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
So how, precisely, does choice happen? How individual is it, really.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c10-p1'>
P2: Integrity is a function of how well a system is integrated. Are any conflicting emotions currently creating instability in me? 

</h3>

<p id='c10-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
Integrity is activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Think of a Roman Arch, and it seems like one of the most static structures we can imagine, just standing there century after century.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
However, that arch which seems so static is doing something, moment by moment.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gravity never stops acting on the stones.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The activity of compression holds the stones in place.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The shape of the arch makes that possible.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If you remove one block you know intuitively the whole arch will suddenly collapse.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That's because you've disrupted the compression, and the integrity of the structure is destroyed.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We're made of pieces of things just like the Roman arch, and these pieces of things are held together by constant activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It sounds simple minded, but this view of being a person is not as simple minded, and much more believable than the theory based on a static self-concept.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
A static self-concept makes a person rigid, not resilient.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There's supposedly some mysterious thing called an 'agent' which makes choices all by itself.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The easiest way to start to dismantle that theory is to get used to the idea that we are each a collection of activities tied to the outside world.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's obvious once you start observing yourself closely.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Doubt becomes your friend, conflicting emotions are not a problem, and disruption becomes creative.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Unlike the Roman arches, life has the ability to reconstruct itself.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Life has intelligence and the ability to make choices.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c10-p2'>
P3: The problem with living in a dream is that real people get hurt. What's my most recent example of that? 

</h3>

<p id='c10-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
The self system is active night and day.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The biological systems are pumping along, obviously.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The emotional systems also have work to do.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When I'm asleep it's pretty simple.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
All my dream characters do what I want them to do without me even trying.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Even this activity is not totally simple because there are always conflicting emotions, and sometimes I wake up from a dream feeling just awful.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When I'm awake and trying to function in the world, my dream characters can be exceedingly troublesome.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
They will not do what I want them to! Suddenly they have their own wants and needs, and maybe I don't do what they expect me to do.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It can be truly a mess.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The only possible solution is to choose to see a dream as a dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Even the most rational narrative about my own life is essentially a dream.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There are individual dreams and collective dreams.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Even the most thoroughly researched scientific theory is essentially a dream - because it is put together and maintained by the human mind manipulating concepts.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Lucky for the rest of us, scientists know this and are always working to debunk each others' dreams.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Therefore they can put together theories that are actually sort of useful in making stuff that works.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I say 'sort of' because so often there are unintended consequences which turn around and bite us.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
How accurate is my theory of who and what you are? Is that going to have unintended consequences which turn around and bite us? It happens all the time.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Especially with people who are way off the mark with their theories of who and what they are.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's been very helpful for me to make a project of noticing when I'm making a real person into a dream character, or when someone is doing it to me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I know it's been helpful because these days I like people so much better than I used to, and I'm getting very positive responses from them.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Sometimes the negative responses are the most helpful in straightening me out, so I refer to them as 'positive' too.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Bad dreams are good dreams if they wake you up.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c10-p3'>
P4: If I'm not feeling my inner body right now, I'm not feeling anything. Take a moment to check in. 

</h3>

<p id='c10-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
In order to direct compassionate attention to the inner body I need to choose to refrain from evaluation, manipulation and interpretation.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I need to trust self-regulation at the deepest levels.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
These biological processes which I am sensing were running millions of years before humans started thinking about them.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When we ignore them, when we lose ourselves in words and images, we're ignoring the foundations of Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Ignoring Gaia, there's no way I can reconnect with basic being.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Physical sensations themselves are not expressing basic being any more than my most random, irrelevant thought expresses basic being.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It's a question of how to rest the mind enough for it to be able to notice the subtlety of basic being as potential, not looking for it as something which exists.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Going into the body, oddly enough, is like going into space.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It can feel liberating.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It can be a relaxation into primordial love.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c10-p4'>
P5: Since Gaia is what's real, any gap in honesty separates us. I can only be honest with myself if I listen to my whole self. How can I do that? 

</h3>

<p id='c10-par10'>
<span class='sentence'>
Setting the intention to be honest with myself is a form of self-regulation.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
But so is self-deception.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Self-deception is a psychological survival strategy, and we better not go to war with it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
There are subconscious forces at work which don't want to be monkeyed with.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Since we depend on social support to be less defensive, listening to my whole self includes listening to other people.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Seeing how certain people in politics and the media are blatantly dishonest can help me to be more honest if I know I don't want to be like them.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can seek out supportive environments.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I am in a social situation which is dangerous, I can protect myself through judicious dishonesty.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Being honest with myself gives me a lot of flexibility.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can choose my friends carefully.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can resist manipulation.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can balance attachment and autonomy.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This is all very rewarding which motivates me to keep going further into the jungle of my mind.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I notice how honesty is much more strongly connected to direct experience than it is to explanation, so I learn to waste less energy on fruitless or fanciful explanations.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I don't judge other people's explanations harshly because I understand how strongly they believe they need to justify and promote themselves, even as my own needs diminish.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being more honest with myself, I can see why people resort to dishonesty.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The ability to deceive oneself and others arose for a reason, and continues for good reasons.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
That's how Gaia works.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
As I set my intention to be honest with myself, or any other intention, I acknowledge that Gaia controls the outcome.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's just how the cookie crumbles.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c10-p5'>
P6: How much power do you think you have? How much do you want? How much power does the other person have? How much do you think they want? 

</h3>

<p id='c10-par12'>
<span class='sentence'>
Machines make us feel powerful.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
From the point of view of Gaia, however, we're kids playing with fire.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Since machines can do so much work for us, we have more time to play.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Since machines can make things cheaply, we have more things, more entertainment based on having lots of things.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Making choices, as in shopping, gives us a sense of power.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia has no reason to prefer living things over machines.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia knows that our resources are limited and that our love for machines, which has a way of quickly becoming our dependence on machines, can squander those resources.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Some people are using a lot more resources than others, which makes those others mad.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
When those others stop playing the game, the game changes for everyone.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
When playing with fire changes the climate, the climate changes for everyone.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The system is self-regulating, and we can only push it so far before it pushes back.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
No matter how powerful we think we are, we are smaller systems running within larger systems, and all these systems are bound by laws.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Our machines are bound by laws.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Now we have machines which can help us study those laws, so let's do that.

<h3 id='c10-p6'>
P7: What am I being touched by right now, physically, emotionally, intellectually?

</h3>

<p id='c10-par14'>
<span class='sentence'>
When I'm walking outside in a strong wind, it's obvious how the wind is touching me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It's less obvious how my reaction to the wind is also touching me.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I know I can't turn the wind off, and yet I react almost as if I could choose to do that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Can I choose to drop my resistance to the wind? I can try.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Then I need to check carefully to see if I'm setting up a struggle, and how that's affecting me overall.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Maybe I can decide to go indoors, if that's a possibility.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
It may be possible, but not desirable in a larger context.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Being human is complicated! I think we can assume that for a frog, if it feels good it is good.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Ah, that sun feels good….until it's too much, and then plop! Back into the water.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Sometimes my life is like that.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But unlike the frog, I can read the news.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can be touched by thoughts of the future.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can be touched by the working conditions of the people who make my shoes.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can be touched by a panoply of images with no idea what I can do about any of it.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
In our world in recent years there has been an explosion of information.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I believe that for a self-regulating system, the more information, the better.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Including the information that I'm making myself crazy with too much information.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Does a frog need to know there might be a drought coming? No, a frog can only deal with the fact that there is a drought starting now.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia has given the frog the ability to do that.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Gaia has also given the frog the ability to deal with the uncertainty of the movements of a fly.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But probably not the ability to worry about it when the fly is not present.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Or the ability to endlessly discuss their speculations about a drought which might be coming.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
That's not what all that croaking is about! Humans can be touched by images of what might happen, our own worries about that, what other people are saying about it, and our desire to make the future better for ourselves and everyone else.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This level of complexity is still new in terms of evolutionary history.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We'll get used to it.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Meanwhile, paying attention to what is touching me in fact now, and what is touching me as a 'maybe', seems like an exercise in sanity.

P8: How does ideology creep into your thinking? What does it offer you? What does it take away from knowing Gaia? 

</h3>

<p id='c10-par16'>
<span class='sentence'>
If I say "I don't think there's any such thing as free will" I'm stating an opinion.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
By itself, an opinion doesn't behave like an ideology.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
An opinion which is part of an ideology is tied to a web of other opinions.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
This web of ideas doesn't have to sound rational to everyone, but to become part of a full blown ideology it helps to have some other people who are 'like minded'.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
At that point the ideas have become a self-regulating system.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If I'm choosing to 'know Gaia' I can't be tied up in any web of ideas.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can't be a person who loves nature.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I can't be a person who is defending the forest.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
I can't be a person who opposes nuclear energy and supports wind farms.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I begin to know Gaia when I begin to know that I am not a person based on identifying with any particular set of ideas, opinions, feelings, or appearances.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What makes me a person is the same thing which makes Gaia Gaia, and I can know that directly only if I'm not caught in the past.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
I need to be able to use ideas which are based on past experience without being trapped by them.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Gaia is not tied to any particular form of life.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
At the same time, it's not true that anything is possible.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
What are the limits of what's possible? I find out every time I make a wrong decision.

It's not in order to get a good night's sleep, even though getting a good night's sleep is important.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
To be in the presence of Gaia is to experience basic being as potential.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
It is to experience the energy of our own system.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
The countless chemical reactions taking place to keep me alive moment by moment do not explain themselves to me.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Elaborate research must be done by specially trained people to explain all that activity.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We experience it as a simple, unitary feeling of aliveness.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If we study the science behind that feeling, we can appreciate it all the more.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
But this exercise of paying attention to breath, paying attention to gravity, pulls us into a part of our mind which isn't concerned with details.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Bringing awareness to this part of the mind releases us from past ideas and beliefs, and brings the possibility of a great reformation.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
Emotion which was fixated on past hurts or past triumphs is suddenly available to propel us into a new motion in a new direction not premeditated.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
The potential of being is available to be pulled into a shape needed by the larger system, by Gaia.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
As we experience basic being our identity eagerly drops the old forms and rushes into the formless.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If this brings up fears of losing my place in the world, the anchors of breath and gravity reassure me that no, this is absolutely natural and ordinary.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
This is not death, this is life.

</span>
</p>
<h3 id='c10-p9'>
P10: Does Gaia have a self? What would that mean?

</h3>

<p id='c10-par20'>
<span class='sentence'>
A self-regulating system must have some sort of self or we wouldn't call it a self-regulating system.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Consider the tropical cyclone, one of the forms of nature which will benefit from a warming climate.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
A cyclone requires an ocean water surface temperature of at least 79 degrees Fahrenheit.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
Once Cyclone A gets up and running, it churns up cooler water making life difficult for Cyclone B which is in its wake.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
We could make a cartoon showing the competition of cyclones as they regulate the water temperature to their own advantage.

</span>
<span class='sentence-alt'>
If Cyclone B had any sense it would steer clear of that cooler water caused by its older sibling.

</span>
<span class='sentence'>
If humans have any sense we will regulate our own use of energy and resources to avoid creating a world which is more suitable for cyclones than for humans.

</p><h2 id='c11'>Ch 11. ~  Contemplation</h2>

<p id='c11-par1'>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation is a way of knowing.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par2'>
<span class='sentence'>
It is a way of processing information.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par3'>
<span class='sentence'>
It is a way of seeing from inside the fire of not knowing.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par4'>
<span class='sentence'>
It is a way of standing in the field of formless potential.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par5'>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation tied to belief might be comforting or it might lead to doubt.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par6'>
<span class='sentence'>
It is unpredictable.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par7'>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation is playful.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par8'>
<span class='sentence'>
We don't know where the thoughts come from.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par9'>
<span class='sentence'>
There's no need to be consistent.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par10'>
<span class='sentence'>
Knowing Gaia is not a goal, it is always new.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par11'>
<span class='sentence'>
Contemplation is not a debate, nor a way of finding what's true.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par12'>
<span class='sentence'>
Knowing Gaia is an attitude.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par13'>
<span class='sentence'>
I must always reconsider.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par14'>
<span class='sentence'>
I can go back to silence.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par15'>
<span class='sentence'>
I can start over.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par16'>
<span class='sentence'>
You will find your own words and your own silence.

</span>
</p>

<p id='c11-par17'>
<span class='sentence'>
You will find your own way of knowing Gaia.
