# Web Components Investigation

This investigation shows a working example of
[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

Based off of 
- [Build an app with WebComponents in 9 minutes](https://youtu.be/mTNdTcwK3MM)
- [Bad-news](https://github.com/marcushellberg/bad-news)

## Todo:
- recreate from scratch the first version
- Important not to do PWA manifest before first
- Requires stripping out code from bad-news/*.{html,js}
