      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
      After many years of Buddhist study and practice, and being influenced by less traditional non-duality speakers, I was inspired to develop a contemplation practice called "Knowing Gaia". I've combined my experience of meditation and a Buddhist world view with a more contemporary approach which is not based on any spiritual authority. In "Knowing Gaia" a scientific world view is bent a little bit in the direction of intuition, poetry and mysticism without making up any stories which contradict our modern common sense. The text is more of an invitation than a guide, and readers are expected to make their own discoveries which may well be radically different from my own.
